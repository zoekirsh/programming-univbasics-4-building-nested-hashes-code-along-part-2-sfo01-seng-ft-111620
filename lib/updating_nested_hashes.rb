   # Write code below that does the following programmatically:
   #
   # - Add an additional :additional_characters key to epic_tragedy and assign it an array as its value
   # - Add two hashes to this array, both with a :name key.
   #   - The first hash should have the :name key set to "Prince Escalus" 
   #   - The second hash should have the :name key set to "Apothecary" 
   # Code your solution here:

epic_tragedy[:additional_characters] = [
